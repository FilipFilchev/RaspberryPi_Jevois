According to Wikipedia: The Last of Us is an American post-apocalyptic drama television series created by Craig Mazin and Neil Druckmann for HBO. 
Based on the video game franchise developed by Naughty Dog, 
the series is set twenty years into a pandemic caused by a mass fungal infection, 
which causes its hosts to transform into zombie-like creatures and collapses society. 
The first season, based on the 2013 game, follows Joel (Pedro Pascal), 
a smuggler tasked with escorting the immune teenager Ellie (Bella Ramsey) across a post-apocalyptic United States. 
The second season is expected to adapt the 2020 sequel, partly following Abby.
